# Introduction

This is one of the series of weekly assignments under Final Project 1. This documentation would be progressive and be distributed in each week's folder.

# The Goal of Week 1
To collect the raw data by conducting web scraping towards AA zones webpages, so that we could make a modern and user-friendly map-based information inquiry interface in the next few classes.

# Highlights

1. Write a JavaScripe For loop to get information that is across multiple pages named in a predicted way. Use the self-executing anonymous function ```javascript // (function () {/*code*/} ) () ``` to solve the problem of "For loop only shows last value of array" 

2. Use ```javascript("000" + num).slice(-4)``` to make sure all numbers are specific-length integer values, so that the file names in the URL could be represented by an uniform unknown number.
